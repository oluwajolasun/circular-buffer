# circular-buffer
A program to demonstrate the operation of a circular buffer.  General description A circular buffer is a type of the first-in-first-out queue, normally fixed in length and is used as a temporary store of information that needs to be transmitted asynchronously from one process to another.  Implementation details The circular buffer holds messages entered by the user which are to be sent to the screen. The operation of the buffer is controlled by a menu from which the user can choose one of the following: enter a new message, send (consume) a message from the buffer or display the contents of the buffer. The buffer is implemented as a fixed-length array. Once all the elements in the array have been filled, the first element will need to be used again. As an example of the operation of the circular buffer, assume that there are 10 elements in the array, 9 messages have been entered by the producer, 6 have been consumed and then a further 5 produced. The next message to be consumed (tail of the buffer) would be the 7th element in the array and the next message entered (head of the buffer) would become the 5th element in the array.  If the number of messages in the buffer is equal to the length of the array and a new message is entered, this simply overwrites the last message at the tail of the buffer. This is termed an overflow.
